# cert-sync

This utility will sync and copy files through sftp.
Personally used to copy wildcard certificates across multiple hobby servers.

It can definitely be used to copy arbitrary files.


# Additional notes:

Honestly, I should have just configured ansible...
But guess what? Another day without python! :D
